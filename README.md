# Multi-Modal-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Transformers

In this project, I have performed the sentiment analysis on both text and images using different tranformer models. It uses BERT for text sentiment analysis and a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) for image sentiment analysis. The goal is to combine these modalities to predict the overall sentiment of a given multi-modal input.
